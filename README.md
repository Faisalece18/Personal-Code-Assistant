## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher

Then install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install requests gradio
```

---

## 🧠 Local Language Model API

This app assumes a local model API (such as [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)) running at:

```
http://localhost:11434/api/generate
```

If your API runs on a different address or port, modify the `url` variable in `app.py` accordingly.

## 🛠 How It Works

When you submit a prompt:

1. Your message is added to a chat history list.
2. A final prompt is generated by concatenating all previous user prompts.
3. The request is sent to the local model using the following JSON:

```json
{
  "model": "CodeWizard",
  "prompt": "<concatenated prompts>",
  "stream": false
}
```

4. The model returns a response, which is appended to the chat.

1. Clone this repository:
```bash

2. Run the application:

3. A Gradio interface will open in your browser. Start chatting!
